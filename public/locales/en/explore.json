    "paragraph1":"<0>IPLD is <1>the data model of the content-addressable web.</1> It allows us to treat all hash-linked data structures as subsets of a unified information space, unifying all data models that link data with hashes as instances of IPLD.</0>",
    "paragraph2": "<0>Content addressing through hashes has become a widely-used means of connecting data in distributed systems, from the blockchains that run your favorite cryptocurrencies, to the commits that back your code, to the webâ€™s content at large. Yet, whilst all of these tools rely on some common primitives, their specific underlying data structures are not interoperable.</0>",
    "paragraph3": "<0>Enter IPLD: a single namespace for all hash-inspired protocols. Through IPLD, links can be traversed across protocols, allowing you to explore data regardless of the underlying protocol.</0>"
